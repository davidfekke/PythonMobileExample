# Example from Mobile demo at PyJax
Here are the last examples I used for my July presentation at the PyJax user group. Start the flask server by using the following command;
```
cd flasktest
python index.py
```

After starting the server, you can open the Xcode project `ConsumePython`, and it will display the items from the flask server in the table view.
